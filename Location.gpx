     Provide one or more waypoints containing a latitude/longitude pair. If you provide one
     waypoint, Xcode will simulate that specific location. If you provide multiple waypoints,
     Xcode will simulate a route visiting each waypoint.

         Optionally provide a time element for each waypoint. Xcode will interpolate movement
         at a rate of speed based on the time elapsed between each waypoint. If you do not provide
         a time element, then Xcode will use a fixed rate of speed.
         
         Waypoints must be sorted by time in ascending order.
